# Harpreet Kaur — Cloud Support Engineer (Entry/Associate)

Cloud Support Engineer focused on resolving production cloud incidents across compute, networking, identity/security, and observability.

I document incidents the way support teams operate: impact → investigation → root cause → fix → prevention.

## How I Solve Cloud Incidents

1. Confirm impact + severity (Sev-1/2/3)
2. Stabilize service first (safe, reversible changes)
3. Isolate fault domain (network vs compute vs IAM vs app)
4. Gather evidence (logs, metrics, configs, recent changes)
5. Identify root cause + validate with tests
6. Fix + confirm recovery end-to-end
7. Prevent recurrence (alerts, guardrails, runbooks, automation)
